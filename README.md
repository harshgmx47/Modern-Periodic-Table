### PERIODIC TABLE
>The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of elements, is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. The structure of the table shows periodic trends


 ### STRATEGY
>Last block of periodic table is incomplete so if new element is found in future element can be easily add by any one in this periodic table.
When cursor is move on any elements then it highlight other elements which can do reaction  with that element.
> Example:-
Oxygen is Reacted with Hydrogen (H2O)(OðŸ¡ªH)
Oxygen is Reacted with Sodium (Na2O) (OðŸ¡ªNa)

![Recation with Oxygen](https://image3.slideserve.com/6645971/equations-reactions-of-metals-with-oxygen-l.jpg "Recation with Oxygen")


> [!NOTE]  
> It has all elements which are naturally  Preset in our environment.Easy to understand  how elements are reacted with each other.Easy to add elements in future by user or any one else.
